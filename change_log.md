x# Change Log for talk3270 rework 
 ## Feb 12, 2026 
1. Fixed the compile error - it was that LocateText function was not defined correctly. It was missing return parm . Fix to be: Int Function LocateText (string pText)
2. Fixed other functions that were left to default to void; added void where it was missing 
2. Change the UtilGetScreenInfo script so it uses the UserBuffer like the rest of the script.
3. Removed unused const and vars from the talk3270.jsm & .jsh files

## Feb 19, 2026 
1. Renamed script, header, & message files from talk3270*.* to rtlOne*.*
2. refactored code in .jss, jsh & .jsm to change var and const from talk3270 or t3270 to ltrOne.
3. Compiled and tested using ltrOneExit.Jss  works as expected 
3. Compiled and tested using ltrOneExitBNS.Jss ltrOneHelpBNS  works as expected 

## TooDo 
1. ?? Should we rename the fields, screens and columns INI files to be more meaningful e.g. ltrOneFieldsDefinition.ini 
2. rename the ltrOneAdmin.ini file to ltrOne.ini to be in line with other support files e.g. ltrOne.jsh
3. Add license check to main code 
	- new include ltrOne.lcn file -- file format 
    	const ltrOneLcnName = '<the company name>',
              ltrOneLcnJfwSer = <nnnnn>,
	          ltrOneLcnSerialNo = "generated by ltrOneLcnBld.jss 
4. Create a license generator called ltrOneLcnBld.jss which can be used from Notepad, etc
	- prompts for client name and their jaws serial no 
	- use the client name and jaws serial no to create a unique ltrOne serial no 
	- popup with ltrOne serial and copied to clipboard 
	- 	- write out the ltrOne.lcn file to be used for compile of ltrOne.jss 
	- code exist in talk3270 archive, 
5. create a new function in ltrOne.jss to verify the license leverage the code from above 
	- on start up check the license if ok continue if not put out a message 
	- "ltrOne is licensed to "client name" for use with JAWS Serial #:" Current JAWS Serial # is nnnnnn 
	- Modify utilScreenInfo to perform this check and add to output license info
